\section{Abstract}
In this report, and project in general, I present a RISC-V ready implementation of the Rainbow signature scheme. The Rainbow signature scheme is a finalist in the NIST standardization of post quantum cryptographic algorithms in the category of signature schemes. The ported version of Rainbow was ran on a simulated PQVexRiscV CPU which communicates with a host device for storage of keys, signatures and messages. The aim with porting this cryptographic scheme to the RISC-V platform was to provide potential optimizations to the platform as well as getting familarity with post quantum cryptographic schemes, Rainbow being in focus.\medskip\\
The optimizations done for the scheme included bitslicing and lookup tables, none of which succeeded to obtain a better cycle count than the ported reference implementation did. However, the bitsliced scheme did get a better cycle/instruction ratio than the two other schemes (standard and lookup table), though had a cycle count that was around 3300\% higher.
